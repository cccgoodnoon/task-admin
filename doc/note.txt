- Add service folder. This folders contains the local application services.  These services encapsulate the operations (such as CRUD) and the communication details with the backend. The backend can be a remote restful server or even a local storage for testing purpose.

attention: The application are divided into two major layers: service and view.  If there's vuex existed, you can regarded the layer organization is as the following:
	view --> vuex store --> service 
or
	view --> vuex store
or 
	view --> service
